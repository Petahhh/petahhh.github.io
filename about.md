Hello!

I'm a web developer at [Scholars Portal](http://scholarsportal.info/), an office of [OCUL](http://www.ocul.on.ca/) housed at [U of T](http://www.utoronto.ca/). I work on our instance of [Openstack Swift](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/), a cloud storage for Ontario University Libraries.
