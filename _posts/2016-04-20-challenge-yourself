I've always been interested and relied on systems. I see a system as a set of agreeded upon protocols or steps with regards to a set of tasks. My very first job was at a catering company. On my first day, my colleague told me to "work smart, not hard". He pointed out several little systems within our workflow that made us more efficient.

In my life, I try to create systems that automate difficult tasks like keeping my apartment in order or staying healthy. With respect to my career and happiness, I feel like constantly challenging myself is a good policy or rule to have. This keeps me on my feet, working towards something new all the time. In may not always be an optimal challenge but always having a challenge ahead of myself systematically ensures I always grow and learn.
