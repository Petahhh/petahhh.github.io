I decided to switch to Jekyll for 2016. 

I really liked working with Wordpress. It was great for client work but it needed to be updated so regularly.

Jekyll is far more interesting to me. I don't think most of the web, or most Wordpress pages, need to be dynamically generated each time. Having static files is light and easy and over this year I'll test it out to see how I like it.
