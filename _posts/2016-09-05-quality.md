Selling quantity is so much easier than selling quality.

You hear about Boxing day sales, long weekend sales and special customer appreciation 30% off all the time. That's because it's easier to tap into the *emotion* that you're getting extra value for something by buying it on sale. The retail industry is pretty bad for this. In my long career in retail, memorizing promotions was a regular part of the work week and used as a tool to sell.

What you don't hear too often are brands that boast about quality. One brand in particular that makes Canadian winter parkas seems to never have advertisements and *never* go on sale. They are pricey but from what I hear from friends and family who own them, they are just high quality.

These high quality purchases are far and few between. You make this kind of purchase once in a while, not as a weekend activity. My money is better spent on high quality items that I can use for years and not throw away for next season's.
